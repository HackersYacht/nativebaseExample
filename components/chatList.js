    //that makes it easier and better to deal with lists.
    //it has a 'data' prop and we assign to it the array that we want it to loop through.
    //we could have used map, but this is much simpler
    //to 'renderItem' prop we pass the component that knows how to render each item in our list
    //in this case it's the Chat component
    //the 'keyExtractor' prop works like the 'key' prop. we give it a function that returns
    //a unique identifier.
